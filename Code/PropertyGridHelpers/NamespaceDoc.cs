    /// developer utilities, and custom control development where enhanced property editing
    /// and metadata-driven configuration are needed.
    ///
    /// While not commonly used in customer-facing applications, the .NET <c>PropertyGrid</c>
    /// control remains a powerful tool for design-time experiences and administrative interfaces.
    /// This library makes it easier to add localization, custom editors, dynamic value sources,
    /// and fine-grained control over property presentation.
