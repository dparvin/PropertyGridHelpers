# PropertyGridHelpers

This library is a tool for helping build software using a PropertyGrid control for changing properties of an object.  It contains attributes and editors for making the object editing easier.  The main feature is the ability to use a checkbox list to choose multiple settings for a single property, used primarily with a flag type Enum.

The following has been done to the project:
* The dll is now built for eight different versions of the .NET framework. (If you need one that is not covered by what is available, let me know and I will try to add it to the list)
* There is a sample control and form in the source code now.
* There are some unit tests for the code, and they are able to run in every .NET framework version the library is compiled in.
